<h3>Tagisan ng Talino - 1st Place</h3>
<div class="p4"><p>2017</p></div>
<p>• I did not expect to win this award. I was just an average student, who was pushed to join the competition<br>and I won without any confidence. This achievement is very memorable to me. I was celebrated by my classmates.<br>I was very glad on this day and I will forever cherish in my life.</p>


<h3>Basketball Final MVP</h3>
<div class="p5"><p>2018</p></div>
<p>• I did not expect to win this award either. I was just did what I usually do and I just have happened to greatly<br>contributed my team to win a championship, which I won the first for my entire life. Winning an achievement <br>with others is so much better to earn a personal award.</p>

<p>• I also won this award with my comrades. This achievement is very memorable as this happened in my <br>freshman year.
